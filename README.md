This repository contains a demo MVP (Minimum Viable Product) created as part of the PIEDS recruitment task. The project implements a basic carbon credit marketplace using blockchain technology.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Note: This is an archived MVP/prototype**

This project is currently in an incomplete state as it was developed as a quick demonstration. I plan to revisit and properly develop this project during my term break (May-June).

- Mint new carbon credits
- List credits for sale
- Purchase credits
- Transfer credits between addresses
- Burn expired credits

## Technical Stack

- Smart Contract: Solidity

## Future Development Plans

During the upcoming term break (May-June), I plan to:
1. Complete the implementation of all core features
2. Add proper validation and error handling

4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Deploy to a test network
6. Add proper documentation
7. Implement additional features like:
   - Carbon credit verification system
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Project impact tracking
